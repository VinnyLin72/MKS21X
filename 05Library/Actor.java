//This class definition tells java that you can compare actors to other actors.   

public abstract class Actor implements Comparable<Actor>{
    //implements Comparable<Actor> requires you make a method
    //   int compareTo (Actor o)
    //in order to be compliant with the Comparable interface
    //this method will compare actors by name

    public int compareTo(Actor other){
	return 0;
	//Try 0-3 and compile and run Demo3 after each one. 
	//If it works comment out the return statement
	//then do the next.
	//0. Modify compareTo so that sorting your Actors will 
	//   sort by name, just use the String compareTo in the names.
	//return name.compareTo(other.getName());
	//1. Modify compareTo so that sorting your Actors will 
	//   sort lowest HP to Highest HP. Then test the driver
	//return health.compareTo(other.getHealth());
	//2. Modify compareTo so that sorting your Actors will 
	//   sort lowest strength to highest strength
	//return strength.compareTo(other.getStrength());
	//This is not a coding question:
	//3. How can we modify the compareTo / the class
	//   so that we are able to sort by the 
	//   "primary stat" (str for barbs int for wiz etc)
	//   come up with a plan, write a list of modifications
	//   you need to make, and where you want the methods to go.
